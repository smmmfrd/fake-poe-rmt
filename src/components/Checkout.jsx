            <p>Path of Exile, is a grinding focussed Action RPG, where there are lots of powerful items gated behind extremely difficult content. There are a lot of youtube channels and websites that showcase "beginner" builds doing this content with little effort, but hiding that the builds are using these rare items, and push unsuspecting new players towards their RMT sites.</p>
            <p>RMT, Real Money Trading, is paying real world money for in game items. It is a common service online, and most games will ban you for doing it, as paying for progress removes any incentive to play the game.</p>
            <p>Grinding Gear Games, the makers of Path of Exile, is extremely good at detecting when a player is RMTing as they keep extensive logs of player trades. When a player receives extremely rare items in a trade while offering nothing, it's pretty obvious and will get your account deleted.</p>
